Africa Neonatal Mortality Rate
Conclusion
Using various visualization methods, we examined the child mortality data and concluded that Sub-Saharan Africa is a highly ranked region. In this region, it was possible to identify three ranges that are far ahead of other countries:

Nigeria,
Democratic Republic Of The Congo,
Ethiopia.
Comparing mortality in these countries over 6 decades, from the 1960s to 2020, we can say that the increase in mortality is more related to political events in these countries and economic crises than to natural conditions. This hypothesis can be proved more thoroughly by comparing these data with datasets on wars and the economic history of Sub-Saharan Africa.

At the same time, it should be noted that great expectations of the world economy are connected with the African continent. This allows us to hope that by 2030 the mortality rate in this region will decrease significantly, and the demographic situation as a whole will become healthier and more stable.
